gentoo-installer
================

A python-based Gentoo installer and management program. I'm porting this app from a PHP version I wrote awhile ago, so for now it's a work in progress. But the concept is to make a RedHat-style terminal-only installer for Gentoo that can set up a whole Gentoo instance based on a settings file. More to come...
